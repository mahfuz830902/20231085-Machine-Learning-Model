# 20231085-Machine-Learning-Model

#Problem:
A scientist is interested in exploring the variables of "HeartDisease.csv" dataset and building a machine-learning model that accurately classifies heart disease or not. This dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features. These datasets were collected and combined in one place to help advance research on heart disease using machine learning algorithms, and hopefully to ultimately advance clinical diagnosis and early treatment. Apply all classification techniques that are known to you and suggest the best model for the classification. Write a scientific report for that scientist after analyzing this data. Upload your report in the google classroom on time. As a data scientist, try to find hidden information from the dataset and mention some advice to your client if you have one.
